# README Generator

## Description

Using the NPM `Inquirer`, the user is prompted with questions in the CML. Using the data collected, we create a quality `README` file.

## Installation

Go to the github repository and clone the code on to your local machine. (must have `node.js` installed)

## Usage

From your local machine open up you CML and run `node index.js` from the root directory. You will be prompted with questions that will be entered into your `README` file once they are answered. Upon completion of the question prompts, a `README` file will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Made with:

- node.js
- javascript
